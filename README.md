#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

I converted a static webpage to a mobile-reade web application. I've add screen reader and responsiveness.
Also app can work offline

How to run this app
Clone the repository

In the terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
